# hello-world
My first Git-hub repository. I want to experiment with some new ideas here....
I am an author, a father, a husband and a graduate. I also have an interest in computer science, and am hoping to build an app which can help gamers, both young and old, track their completed, and none completed games collections. I need to find a way to make this appealing, but both hardcore gamers such as myself, and noobs as well.
I could include things such as Amazon product picture grabs, for the game's id images, and also for the xbox one games, some customized character histories, win rate for fighting games, or soldier rank for the COD Blops games, for example. I also want to add a database, which the players can link to. Where they can share gamer messages. This thing could be big? I need to think of a catchy title?
